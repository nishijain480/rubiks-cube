Now solving the BOTTOM LAYER
First turn the cube so that the face facing the earth, comes to the top.
now make a + in the middle at the top layer 
Now we have 4 possibilities          
   a) only center fix piece is in its position
   b) pieces in L shape are  arranged
   c) a vertical line in center and a horizontal line are set
   d) a + is already set in center
if we are at (a) condition ,apply FRUR'U'F'    3 times to reach stage (d).
if we are at (b) condition ,apply FRUR'U'F'    2 times to reach stage (d).
if we are at (a) condition ,apply FRUR'U'F'    1 times to reach stage (d).
